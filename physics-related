Geant4
"Geant4 is an open-source toolkit that enables [sic! "one to simulate particle passage through matter." or "...simulation of particle passage through matter."] to simulate particle passage through matter. 
It is written in C++ and offers a wide range of tools for users to employ in their applications. 
More information on the overview of the package can be found in the Introduction to Geant4."

    - Not quite there yet in terms of Conceptual Indexing and question-based indexing of Conversational Hypertext with Conversational Search Agents and Course Checksheet of tasks and integrated interactive exercises, but it's on the right path. 
    (also needs tooltip word definitions, biographical and historical footnote tooltips and interactive annotations (e.g. colored highlighting, icon for notes, text note or comment on document, underlining text and other text decorations, drawing on document etc.) and note clipping of quotes with citation particulars for Obsidian, Notion and Miro Whiteboard)
